# Stay-Frosty-Final-Project
Our MATLAB/Arduino Final Project using a PIR Sensor and a relay to control a fan

## Problem Statement
The objective of this experiment is to use a PIR motion sensor to control a fan as a on/off switch. 
The PIR sensor will be used to detect if there is someone in front of the fan where then the raw sensor 
data will be transferred to the MATLAB® program. If the sensor data passes a certain threshold 
the fan will be activated and then controlled by the user if they decide to keep than fan on or 
switch it off using MATLAB®
